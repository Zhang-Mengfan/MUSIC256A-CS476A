# Music256A / CS476A Music, Computing, Design I: Artful Design of Computer Music

Final Project of Music256A / CS476A. [[Project Website](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~zhangmf/256a/final/)] The course instructor is Prof. [Ge Wang](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~ge/). 

This is an Unity game. You can make a "twinkle twinkle little star" song while you are playing the game. There are three chords, C major chord, F major chord and G major chord in the game. Each time the person runs through a fire, a note is created. It feels like you are running on a piano. 

You can also change the mode by pressing "M". By jumping, running through the fire or beating the floating eye, you can easily make some electronic music.
